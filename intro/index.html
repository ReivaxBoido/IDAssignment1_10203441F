<h2>Hello!</h2>
<h3>I'm Xavier Teo,</h3>
<p>Im 17 as of 2020, my birthday is on 6th February and a fun fact about me is I like games (suprise?).
I chose IT as I always had an interest in programming since Primary School when I was in the IT club, over the years I honed my programming skills by joining a programming club in Secondary School and learrning programming from the internet during my free time.
I decided to join IT specifically as after careful consideration I realised I wanted to help people by using technology to share information to the public.
I EAE'd into Ngee Ann as Ngee Ann was recommended by my peers and other adults as the top choice to enter to further advance my programming knowledge.</p>
