<h2>Computer Games</h2>
<p>I play many computer games but here's some of the more frequent ones I usually play.</p><br>

<img src="wf.jpg" alt="Warframe" class="response">
<h3>Warframe</h3>
<p>Warframe is a free-to-play action role-playing third-person shooter multiplayer online game developed and published by Digital Extremes. I began playing warframe since early 2019 and have played for over 1700 hours on this title alone.
One of the main reason I like warframe is the choices the game gives you. For example, you can complete a capture mission by going in stealthily, capturing the target and running away, or you can run and gun everything in your way throughout the entire mission.</p>

<img src="os.jpg" alt="Osu" class="response">
<h3>osu!</h3>
<p>osu! is a rhythm game primarily developed, published and created by Dean "peppy" Herbert. I play osu! mainly for relaxation and at the same time challenge my hand eye coordination, don't let its simplicity fool you, osu! is challenging at the higher levels.</p>

<img src="mc.jpg" alt="Minecraft" class="response">
<h3>Minecraft</h3>
<p>Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by Mojang. Minecraft gives me the power to create almost any idea I can think of. It's a great platform to develop my creativity and at the same time play and explore it's vast worlds with friends.</p>
